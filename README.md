# PuckLab

PuckLab is the interface built to control e-puck2 robots at UNamur. It embarks visual programming concepts along with more advanced toolings through Python.

The goal is to simplify access and development of specific scenarii on the e-puck2 robots for the UNamur staff of the robotic lab.

## Details
All details on the tool and why it came to life are available and well written in French in the LaTeX project on the `main` branch.
