### Application Layer

#### Robot Service
The main application service in [`application/services.py`](../../src/robot/application/services.py) orchestrates all robot operations:
- **Hardware Coordination**: Manages all hardware components through dependency injection
- **Command Processing**: Executes Python commands safely in a controlled environment
- **Status Reporting**: Provides comprehensive robot status including sensor data
- **State Management**: Coordinates state changes with visual and audio feedback

#### WebSocket Service
Handles client connections and message processing:
- **Connection Management**: Tracks multiple client connections with automatic cleanup
- **Message Routing**: Routes different message types to appropriate handlers
- **Real-time Communication**: Ping/pong heartbeat and status broadcasting
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting with graceful degradation

### Use Cases

#### Command Executor
Located in [`application/use_cases.py`](../../src/robot/application/use_cases.py), provides safe Python code execution:
- **Sandbox Environment**: Controlled execution environment with whitelisted functions and modules
- **Async Support**: Handles both synchronous and asynchronous Python code
- **Hardware Access**: Provides direct access to robot hardware through safe interfaces
- **Error Isolation**: Prevents malicious or erroneous code from crashing the system

#### State Manager
Implements sophisticated state management:
- **State Transitions**: Validates state changes according to business rules
- **Visual Feedback**: Updates LED colors and patterns based on current state
- **Audio Feedback**: Plays distinctive sounds for different state transitions
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic error state handling with recovery mechanisms

#### Health Monitor
Continuous system health monitoring:
- **Sensor Validation**: Periodic sensor health checks
- **Connection Monitoring**: Tracks client connections and system responsiveness
- **Automatic Recovery**: Switches to error state when issues are detected
- **Background Operation**: Runs independently without blocking main operations

### Infrastructure Layer

#### Hardware Implementations
Each hardware component has a dedicated implementation:

- **EPuck2Motor** ([`infrastructure/epuck2_motor.py`](../../src/robot/infrastructure/epuck2_motor.py)): Motor control using the pi-puck library with speed clamping and safety features
- **EPuck2Sensors** ([`infrastructure/epuck2_sensors.py`](../../src/robot/infrastructure/epuck2_sensors.py)): Comprehensive sensor reading with error handling
- **EPuck2LEDs** ([`infrastructure/epuck2_leds.py`](../../src/robot/infrastructure/epuck2_leds.py)): LED control with pattern support and color management
- **EPuck2Audio** ([`infrastructure/epuck2_audio.py`](../../src/robot/infrastructure/epuck2_audio.py)): Audio playback with frequency control and sound effects

## üåê WebSocket Protocol

The robot server implements a comprehensive WebSocket protocol for real-time communication. Full protocol documentation is available in [`websocket-protocol.md`](./websocket-protocol.md).

### Message Types
- **COMMAND**: Execute Python code on the robot
- **PING/PONG**: Connection health monitoring
- **STATUS**: Robot status requests and updates
- **SUCCESS/ERROR**: Operation results and error reporting

### Connection Flow
1. **Client Connection**: WebSocket connection to `/robot` endpoint
2. **Authentication**: Path validation and client registration
3. **Status Update**: Initial robot status broadcast
4. **Message Loop**: Continuous message processing
5. **Cleanup**: Automatic resource cleanup on disconnection

## üîí Security Features

- **Host Detection**: Automatic network interface detection
- **Port Configuration**: Configurable WebSocket port (default 8765)
- **Connection Limits**: Configurable client connection limits

### Logging Configuration
Comprehensive logging system in [`config/logging.py`](../../src/robot/config/logging.py):

- **Multiple Handlers**: Console and file logging with rotation
- **Level Configuration**: Environment-based log level control
- **Performance Monitoring**: Request timing and resource usage logging

## üîÑ Lifecycle Management

### Startup Sequence
The server startup process in [`main.py`](../../src/robot/main.py) includes:
1. **Configuration Loading**: Network and logging configuration
2. **Hardware Initialization**: All hardware components are initialized and tested
3. **Service Creation**: Application services are created with dependency injection
4. **Server Start**: WebSocket server starts accepting connections
5. **Health Monitoring**: Background health monitoring begins

### Graceful Shutdown
The shutdown process ensures clean resource cleanup:
1. **Signal Handling**: SIGTERM and SIGINT are handled gracefully
2. **Connection Closure**: All client connections are closed properly
3. **Hardware Cleanup**: All hardware components are cleaned up
4. **Resource Deallocation**: Memory and file handles are released

### Error Recovery
The system implements multiple levels of error recovery:
- **Component Level**: Individual hardware components can recover from errors
- **Service Level**: Services can restart failed components
- **System Level**: The entire system can restart if critical errors occur

## üìä Monitoring and Observability

### Health Metrics
The system provides comprehensive health metrics:
- **Hardware Status**: Individual component health and responsiveness
- **Connection Metrics**: Number of active connections and message throughput
- **Performance Metrics**: Command execution times and resource usage
